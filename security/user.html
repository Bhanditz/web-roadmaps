        <p data-feature="Encryption">The <a data-featureid="crypto">Web Cryptography API</a> provides a first step toward enabling secure authentication and communication from the browser, with standard APIs to cryptographic functions such as encryption, decryption, signing, hashing, and verification. WebCrypto allows a web developer to build in their application a reliable security model protecting the user (such as authentication or secure communication between the browser and the server).</p>

        <h2>Specifications in progress</h2>

        <p data-feature="Authorization">Most browsers offer to store and protect their users' credentials to simplify authentification; the <a data-featureid="credential-management">Credential Management API</a> offers to further streamline that authentification by allowing Web applications to detect and automatically use these credentials if authorized.</p>
        <p data-feature="Authentication">Building on the multi-factor authentication work of the FIDO Alliance, <a data-featureid="webauthn">Secure Authentication</a> aims to standardize multi-factor authentication for the Web, using the combination of "something you have" with "something you know," so that hacking a password database is no longer sufficient to hijack user accounts.</p>
        <p data-feature="Secure contexts"><a data-featureid="securecontexts">Secure Contexts</a> recommends that powerful features of the Web platform, including application code with access to sensitive or private data, be delivered only in secure contexts, over authenticated and confidential channels that guarantee data integrity. As the draft indicates, "delivering code securely cannot ensure that an application will always meet a user's security and privacy requirements, but it is a necessary precondition."</p>

        <p data-feature="Authentication"><a data-featureid="hbss">Hardware Based Secure Services</a> aims to improve the levels of assurance to which users and application providers are able to protect their online accounts and communications, by making hardware security services available to the Web.</p>
