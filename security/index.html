    <h1>Roadmap of Security Technologies for the Web</h1>
                <p>
                  Securing the Web is a multi-layered challenge. To secure the Web experience of end-users: its confidentiality, integrity, and authentication; we need to provide tools for end-users, for application developers, and for platform security. Moreover, the security of Web applications depends on underlying protocols, on browser and server software, hence we need to enlist the cooperation of participants throughout the ecosystem.
