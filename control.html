        <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h3>
        <p data-feature="Control of one local media element">All the basic interactions one expects from a media player (play, pause, playrate, etc.) are available in JavaScript via the <a data-featureid="htmlmediaelement"><code>HTMLMediaElement</code> interface</a> defined in HTML.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="featureset in-progress">
          <h2>Specifications in progress</h3>
          <p data-feature="Audio control">The <a data-featureid="webaudio">Web Audio API</a> defines a full-fledged audio processing API that gives precise control over the playback of audio content.</p>
          <p data-feature="Key-based control">A number of media-capable devices expose specific hardware keys and buttons to facilitate control of playing media; the <a data-featureid="mediakeys">Media Keys in DOM Level 3 events</a> propose exposing these interactions to Web-based players.</p>

        <section class="featureset exploratory-work">
          <h2>Exploratory work</h3>
          <p data-feature="Control of multiple local media elements">The <a data-featureid="mediacontroller"><code>MediaController</code> interface</a> proposes to control several media resources from within a single control point but has found <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/192">limited implementation support</a> so far.</p>

          <p data-feature="OS-wide media control">In any given Web application, media playback can be in competition with media playback from other applications, and the underlying operating system is in charge of determining which of these applications should have the media focus. The <a data-featureid="mediasession">Media session</a> specification expose these changes of focus to Web applications.</p>
          <p data-feature="Tuner control">Devices which can access broadcast content need to offer ways to select which broadcast signal to play; the <a data-featureid="tvtuner">Tuner interface in TV Control API</a> provides such an interface for broadcast TV.</p>
<p data-feature="Local network media control">The <a data-featureid="discovery">Network Service Discovery API</a> provides integration with local network-based media renderers, such as those enabled by DLNA, UPnP, etc., allowing to send control commands to them. At this time, the future of this specification is uncertain, given the difficulty of finding the right balance between the requirements of the Web security model and the desire to be compatible with existing devices.</p>
          <p data-feature="Multi-device media control">The Multi-Device Timing Community Group is exploring media control across devices: its <a data-featureid="timing">Timing Object</a> specification enables to coordinate the playback of multiple video, audio and other data streams in close synchrony, across devices and independently of the network topology.</p>
          <p data-feature="Virtual reality control">For immersive media experiences enabled by Virtual Reality headsets, media content needs to be adjusted based on the viewer’s head position, orientation and velocity. The work on the <a data-featureid="webvr">WebVR</a> specification addresses this need as well as other needs related to displaying 360° content.</p>

            <dt>Radio Tuner Control</dt>
            <dd>Devices that expose radio tuners should be controlable via browsers the same way the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/tvcontrol-api/">TV Control API</a> offers to control TV tuners.</dd>
