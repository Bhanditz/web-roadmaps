          <p data-feature="Multi-device media control">The Multi-Device Timing Community Group is exploring media control across devices: its <a data-featureid="timing">Timing Object</a> specification enables to coordinate the playback of multiple video, audio and other data streams in close synchrony, across devices and independently of the network topology.</p>
          <p data-feature="Local network media control">The <a data-featureid="discovery">Network Service Discovery API</a> provides integration with local network-based media renderers, such as those enabled by DLNA, UPnP, etc., allowing to send control commands to them. At this time, the future of this specification is uncertain, given the difficulty of finding the right balance between the requirements of the Web security model and the desire to be compatible with existing devices.</p>
