            <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
            
            <p>Due to their limited CPU, and more importantly to their limited battery, mobile devices require a lot of 
                attention in terms of performance.</p>
            
            <div data-feature="Timing Hooks">
                <p>The work started by the <a class="dupref" href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">Web Performance Working Group</p> 
                    on <cite><strong><a data-featureid="nav-timing">Navigation Timing</a></strong></cite>, 
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="resource-timing">Resource Timing</a></strong></cite>, 
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="perf-timeline">Performance Timeline</a></strong></cite>, and 
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="user-timing">User Timing</a></strong></cite>, gives tools to Web developers for 
                    optimizing their Web applications. The work on the 
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="frame-timing">Frame Timing API</a></strong></cite> aims at providing detailed 
                    information on the frame-per-second obtained when an application is running on the user device.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="Network Prioritization">
                <p>The <cite><strong><a data-featureid="resource-hints">Resource Hints</a></strong></cite> and 
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="preload">Preload</a></strong></cite> specifications let developers optimize 
                    the download of resources by enabling to delay either the download or the execution of the downloaded 
                    resource.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="Priority Handling">
                <p>The proposed work on <cite><strong><a data-featureid="setimmediate">Efficient Script Yielding</a></strong></cite> offers the 
                    opportunity to Web developers to use more efficiently asynchronous programming, but has so far 
                    gained very limited traction.</p>
                
                <p>The <code><strong><a data-featureid="idle-callback">requestIdleCallback</a></strong></code> API similarly 
                    proposes a way for scheduling an operation at the next opportunity when the app is not processing 
                    another operation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="Page Visibility Detection">
                <p>The <a data-featureid="visibilitychange">API to determine whether a Web page is being displayed</a> 
                    (<cite><strong>Page Visibility API</strong></cite>) can also be used to adapt the usage of resources 
                    to the need of the Web application, for instance by reducing network activity when the page is minimized.</p>
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Animation Optimization">
                <p>Likewise, the <cite><strong><a data-featureid="animation-timing">Timing control for script-based animations API</a></strong></cite> 
                    can help reduce the usage of resources needed for playing animations.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Threading">
                <p>Beyond optimization of resources, the perceived reactivity of an application is also a critical aspect of 
                    the mobile user experience. The <strong>thread-like mechanism</strong> made possible via 
                    <cite><a data-featureid="webworkers">Web Workers</a></cite> allows keeping the user interface responsive 
                    by offloading the most resource-intensive operations into a background process.</p>
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Battery Status">
                <p>The <a data-featureid="battery">battery API</a> allows adjusting the use of resources to the current level
                    of power available in the battery of a mobile device.</p>
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Optimization Best Practices">
                <p>The <cite><strong><a data-featureid="mwabp">Mobile Web Application Best Practices</a></strong></cite> provide general advice 
                    on how to build Web applications that work well on mobile devices, taking into account in particular the 
                    needs for optimization. The opportunity to update these best practices is 
                    <a href="https://github.com/w3c-webmob/mobile_best_practices">under discussion</a> in the 
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/IG/">Web and Mobile Interest Group</a>.</p>
