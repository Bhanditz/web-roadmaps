            <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
            
            <p>Mobile devices follow their users everywhere, and hold some of their most private or confidential
                data (contacts, pictures, calendar, etc.) As a result, it is critical for users to be able to rely
                on their phones to keep that data safe from attackers.</p>
            
            <p>W3C specifications are reviewed for their security and privacy impact as part of their progress 
                through the Recommendation track; the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Privacy/">Privacy Interest Group</a>
                and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/IG">Web Security Interest Group</a> in particular 
                are coordinating reviews on their respective fields.</p>            
            
            <div data-feature="Permission Management">
                <p>Many sensitive APIs are gated by a request for user consent; while these requests give control to
                    the user, they can be sometimes hard to integrate in the overall user experience without visibility
                    on which permission has been granted or denied. The 
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="permissions">Permissions API</a></strong></cite> aims at fixing this.</p>
                
                <p>But beyond these cross-technology considerations, a number of ongoing work items address needs for 
                    additional protection.</p>
                
                <p>The first line of defense for users, and the unit of isolation for Web apps is the same-origin policy
                    that roughly limits what a Web application can access to content and data hosted on the same origin, 
                    i.e. the combination of URL scheme, domain name and port.</p>
                
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Strengthened Security">
                <p>For legacy reasons, this policy is not as stringent on some parts of the Web platform, exposing users
                    to greater attack surface via cross-site scripting or cross-site request forgery. To enable Web 
                    application authors to reduce the attack surface beyond what legacy requires, the 
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="csp">Content Security Policy (level 2)</a></strong></cite> offers 
                    hooks that severely limits damages that an attacker could hope to achieve.</p>
                
                <p>To further strengthen the integrity of their applications, Web developers can make use of the proposed
                    <cite><strong><a data-featureid="subres-integrity">Subresource integrity</a></strong></cite> mechanism, 
                    that makes it possible to block man-in-the-middle attacks or compromised third-parties providers.</p>
                
                <p><a data-featureid="epr">Entry Point Regulation</a> provides another 
                    layer of strengthening and offers to filter the type of HTTP requests that can be made from external 
                    sites, reducing risks of cross-site script and cross-site request forgery.</p>
                
                <p>In applications that aggregate content from multiple (possibly untrusted) sources, the 
                    <a data-featureid="iframe-sandbox">HTML5 <code>iframe</code> sandbox</a> makes it possible to restrict 
                    what kind of interactions third-party embedded content can make use of.</p>
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Encryption">
                <p>As described earlier, the <a data-featureid="crypto">Web Cryptography API</a> provides the necessary 
                    tools to encrypt data for storage and transmission from within Web applications, with access 
                    pre-provisioned keys via the <strong><a data-featureid="cryptokey">WebCrypto Key Discovery</a></strong> API.</p>
                
                <p>There are discussions to bring the capabilities of hardware-security modules to the Web, to enable access to 
                    high-security operations for encryption, payment, identity proof, etc., embodied in a 
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/hasec/2015-hasec-charter.html"> draft charter for a Hardware Security Working Group</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Tracking Protection">
                <p>For users that wish to indicate their preferences not to be tracked across Web applications and sites, the 
                    <a data-featureid="dnt">Tracking Preference Expression (also known as Do No Track)</a> enables browsers to
                    communicate explicitly their wish to content providers, and to determine whether a given content provider 
                    asserts fulfilling that wish.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="Identity Management">
                <p>To facilitate the authentication of users to on-line services, the Web Application Security Working Group is 
                    proposing a <a data-featureid="credential-management">credential management API</a> that lets developers 
                    interact more seamless with user-agent-managed credentials.</p>
