            <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
            
            <p>Network connectivity represents a major asset for mobile devices: the Web is an immense store of content, as well as an almost endless source of processing power, overcoming two of the limitations of mobile devices.</p>
            <p>The Web platform is growing a number of APIs that facilitate establishing network connectivity in different contexts.</p>
            
            <div data-feature="HTTP(s) Network API">
                <p> <strong><a data-featureid="xmlhttpreq">XMLHttpRequest</a></strong> 
                    (the basis for Ajax development) is a widely deployed API to load content 
                    from Web servers using the HTTP and HTTPs protocol: the W3C specification (formerly known as XMLHttpRequest Level 2) was meant
                    to document the existing deployed API (with the ability to make requests on servers in a different domain, programmatic feedback
                    on the progress of the network operations, and more efficient handling of binary content), but that
                    <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2015JulSep/0248.html"> work is now likely to be done
                    only in the WHATWG </a>. The WHATWG <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">fetch API</a> also provides a more 
                    powerful Promise-based alternative.</p>

                <p> The <strong><a data-featureid="beacon">Beacon API</a></strong> aims at letting
                    developers queue unsupervised HTTP requests, leaving it to the browser to execute 
                    them when appropriate, opening the door for better network optimizations.</p>
                
                <p> Early work on a <strong><a data-featureid="background-sync">Web Background Synchronization API</a></strong> 
                    would provide a robust Service Worker-based mechanism to enable Web applications to download and upload 
                    content in the background, even in the absence of a running browser.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="Cross-domain Requests">
                <p> By default, browsers do not allow to make request across different domains (or more specifically, across
                    different origins, a combination of the protocol, domain and port) from a single Web page; this rule protects
                    the user from having a Web site abusing their credentials and stealing their data on another Web site. Sites 
                    can opt-out of that rule by making use of the <strong><a data-feature="cors">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a></strong> 
                    mechanism, opening up much wider cooperation across Web applications and services. </p>
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-feature="Server-pushed Requests">
                <p> XMLHttpRequest is useful for client-initiated network requests, but mobile devices with their limited network
                    capabilities and the cost that network requests induce on their battery (and sometimes on their users bill) 
                    can often make better use of server-initiated requests. The <strong><a data-featureid="server-sent">Server-Sent
                    Events API</a></strong> allows triggering DOM events based on push notifications (via HTTP and other protocols.)</p>
                
                <p> Early work on a <strong><a data-featureid="push">Push API</a></strong> would allow Web applications to receive 
                    server-sent messages whether or not the said Web app is active in a browser window. An 
                    <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/webpush/current/msg00007.html">IETF Working Group charter</a>
                    is under discussion to standardize the protocol aspects of the mechanism.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="Bidirectional Connections">
                <p> The <strong><a data-featureid="websockets">WebSocket API</a></strong>, built on top of the 
                    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-05">IETF WebSocket protocol</a>, 
                    offers a bidirectional, more flexible, and less resource intensive network connectivity than XMLHttpRequest.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="P2P Data Connections">
                <p> The work on <strong><a data-featureid="webrtc-qos">Web Real-Time Communications</a></strong> will also 
                    provide direct <strong>peer-to-peer data connections</strong> between browsers with real-time characteristics, 
                    opening the way to collaborative multi-devices Web applications.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div data-feature="On-line State">
                <p> Of course, an important part of using network connectivity relies on being able to determine if such 
                    connectivity exists, and the type of network available. The <strong><a featureid="online-domflag">HTML5 onLine DOM 
                    flag</a></strong> (and its associated change event, ononline) signals when network connectivity is 
                    available to the Web environment.</p>
            </div>

            <div data-feature="Network Characteristics">
                <p> The <strong><a data-featureid="network-info">network-information API</a></strong>, which was supposed to address
                    discovery of the network characteristics, has been abandoned for the time being due to lack of clear supporting 
                    <a href="http://w3c-webmob.github.io/netinfo-usecases/">use cases</a>.</p>
                
                <p> The <strong><a data-featureid="resource-timing">Resource Timing API</a></strong> offers to measure 
                    precisely the impact of the network on the time needed to load various resources, offering another 
                    approach to adapt a Web app to its network environment.</p>
