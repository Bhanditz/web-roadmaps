            <p>Network connectivity represents a major asset for mobile devices: the Web is an immense store of content, as well as an almost endless source of processing power, overcoming two of the limitations of mobile devices.</p>
            <p>The Web platform is growing a number of APIs that facilitate establishing network connectivity in different contexts.</p>
            
            <p data-feature="HTTP(s) Network API"><strong><strong><a data-featureid="" data-feature="">XMLHttpRequest</a></strong> 
                (the basis for Ajax development) is a widely deployed API to load content 
                from Web servers using the HTTP and HTTPs protocol: the W3C specification (formerly known as XMLHttpRequest Level 2) was meant
                to document the existing deployed API (with the ability to make requests on servers in a different domain, programmatic feedback
                on the progress of the network operations, and more efficient handling of binary content), but that
                <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2015JulSep/0248.html"> work is now likely to be done
                only in the WHATWG </a>. The WHATWG <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">fetch API</a> also provides a more 
                powerful Promise-based alternative.</p>
