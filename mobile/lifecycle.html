                <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
                
                <p> An important aspect of the user experience of applications is linked to how the user perceives the said 
                    application is available permanently (even when off-line, which is particularly important on mobile devices), 
                    as well as its ability to get started based on external notifications.</p>

                <p> These notions are part of the overall <em>application lifecycle</em>: how applications get installed, shown to the 
                    user in applications list, started, stopped, woken up from remote notifications, synced up when the device 
                    goes on-line. </p>

                <p> These various capabilities are brought the Web platform through different mechanisms.</p>

                <p> Although the notion of installed Web applications is still not well-defined, there are several components 
                    to the notion of installation that are under development.</p>
                
                <div data-feature="Packing">
                    <p><strong><a data-featureid="packaging">Packaging on the Web</a></strong> describes a Web-adapted format to make 
                        Web content available in a singe file for ease of download, sharing or archiving.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether packaged or not, users rely on a variety of metadata (name, icons) to identify the apps they want to use
                        among their list of regularly used applications. The <strong><a data-featureid="manifestjson">JSON-based manifest format
                        </a></strong> lets developers group all these metadata in a single JSON file.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div data-feature="Offline Web Apps">
                    <p>HTML5â€™s <code><strong><a data-featureid="manifest">ApplicationCache</a></strong><code> enables access to Web applications 
                        off-line through the definition of a manifest of files that the browser is expected to keep in its cache.</p>
                    
                    <p>While relatively well deployed, the current approach has shown some strong limitations in terms of how much developers can
                        control what gets cached when. The Web Applications Working Group has thus been developing a more powerful approach, 
                        <strong><a data-featureid="serviceworkers">ServiceWorker</a></strong>.</p>
                        
                </div>

                <div data-feature="Scheduled Tasks">
                    <p>Not only does Service Worker enables Web applications to work seamlessly off-line or in poor network conditions, 
                        it also creates a model for Web applications to operate when they have not been opened in a browser window, 
                        or even if the browser itself is not running.</p>
                        
                    <p>That ability opens the door for Web applications that run in the background and can react to remotely 
                        triggered events.</p>

                    <p>The <strong><a data-featureid="task-scheduler">Task Scheduler API</a></strong> makes it possible to trigger a task
                        at a specified time via the Web app service worker. While the System Applications Working Group in which this API
                        was developed has closed, the ServiceWorker-based approach taken in the specifications may make it an interesting
                        starting point for further work in this space.</p>
                </div>

                <div data-feature="Geofencing">
                    <p>Similarly, the new <strong><a data-featureid="geofencing">geofencing API</a></strong> enables to wake up a Web app when a
                        device enters a specified geographical area.</p>
                </div>

                <div data-feature="Remote Notifications">
                    <p>The <strong><a data-featureid="push">Push API</a></strong> enables Web applications to subscribe to remote 
                        notifications that, upon reception, wake them up. Native applications have long enjoyed the benefits of 
                        greater user engagement that these notifications bring, and soon Web applications will share that ability.</p>
                </div>

                <div data-feature="Background Sync">
                    <p>Likewise, the <strong><a data-featureid="background-sync">Web Background Synchronization</a></strong> specification will enable Web applications to keep their user data 
                        up to date seamlessly, by running network operations in the background.</p>
                </div>

                <div data-feature="Foreground Detection">
                    <p>The <strong><a data-featureid="visibilitychange">Page Visibility</a></strong> specification lets developers detect when their application is in the foreground, and thus adapt their operations and resource consumption accordingly.</p>
